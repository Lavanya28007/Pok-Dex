This project uses PokeAPI as the data source.
It provides structured JSON data including:
- Pokemon name
- stats
- type
- abilities
- images

Dynamic pages are generated using:
- /pokemon/[name]
- /pokemon/type/[type]
- /pokemon/ability/[ability]

Each route fetches live data server-side and renders SEO-optimized pages.
